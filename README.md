Task1: Trained the supervised classification on synthetic dataset and MNIST dataset using the one-vs-all classifier algorithm.

Task2:	Formulated linear programs and implemented the k-mean algorithm to do unsupervised clustering for the given dataset.

Task3: Implemented and compared label selection algorithms to find the most informative data for semi-supervised learning.
